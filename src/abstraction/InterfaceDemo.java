	 * Interface ------------- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation
	 * details and showing only functionality to the user.
	 * 
	 * Interface ------------- An intgerface is a blue print of class. Interface
	 * contains final & Static variables. Interface contains abstract methods.( also
	 * allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards) An abstract
	 * method is a method contains definition but not body(Un-implemented method).
	 * Methods in interface are public. Interface supports the functionality of
	 * multiple inheritance. We can define interface with interface keyword. A class
	 * extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class
	 * implements an interface. We can create Object reference for Interface but we
	 * cannot instantiate interface.
